What is Apache AGE(Incubating)?
--------------
Apache AGE is a PostgreSQL extension that provides graph database functionality. AGE stands for AgensGraph Extension and is inspired by Bitnine's AgensGraph. The goal of this project is to create a single repository that can process both relational and graph model data so that users can use standard ANSI SQL with the graph query language [openCypher](https://www.opencypher.org/). This is PostgreSQL's first graph database extension, and will provide an environment that anyone can use easily.
The project is in alpha stage now and it is currently being developed in the form of an extension for PostgreSQL 11.
